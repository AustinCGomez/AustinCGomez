## Cybersecurity Professional and avid hobbyist software developer

### About Me: 
I'm a software developer that loves to build open source software projects from scratch and also contribute to existing open source projects. I also enjoy cybersecurity with a focus on the web penetration testing. 

### Languages: 
- Python
- C# 
- Javascript 
- HTML
- CSS

### Projects: 
Web - A big focus of mine in 2023 is getting into full-stack web development. I'm learning C# and .NET for backend developement while I am honing my front-end skills by furtherign my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I might alos go back into some Django back-end websites. 

Windows Apps - I am working on creating a Windows Store app called 'Open Pomodoro Timer'. It'll be a C# XAML application that helps you focus for a set amount of time. It'll be the first Pomodoro timer on the Windows Store that is open source where the open source developer community can define and develop its future features. 

CLI Tools - I built a command line tool called PythonFileMover and currently maintain it. I might look into some new ideas for command line projects in the near future.
