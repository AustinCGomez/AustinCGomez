## Senior at the Univeristy of Alabama in Huntsville
Majoring in Information Systems /w a concentration in Cyber Security. I have loved programming for quite some year now. However, I now enjoy the full-scope of the software development process from system analysis to writing the code. 

## Areas of Interest: 
- Web Development & Databases: I love making databases then creating awesome web-fronts to display the data for the public.
- Cyber Security: I find this area of study to be interesting in many ways. 

## Personal & University Projects 
These are some projects that I have made for my courses at The University of Alabama in Huntsville! Many of them are demos and in a non-productive state(As servers cost money). You can still set-up most of them to work with the instructions that I provide. 

## Maintainer & Original Projects
These are my projects that I decided to make and maintain them as productive software projects! You are more than welcome to contribute to them and help spread the love of open source projects. 

## Projects I love! 
These are some projects that I have contributed, in some fashion, but which were made originally by other brilliant people and organizations.
