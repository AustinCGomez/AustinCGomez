## Senior at the Univeristy of Alabama in Huntsville
Majoring in Information Systems /w a concentration in Cyber Security. I have loved programming for quite some year now. However, I now enjoy the full-scope of the software development process from system analysis to writing the code. 

# Areas of Interest: 
- Web Development & Databases: I love making databases then creating awesome web-fronts to display the data for the public.
- Cyber Security: I find this area of study to be interesting in many ways. 

# Personal & University Projects 
These are some projects that I have made for my courses at The University of Alabama in Huntsville! Many of them are demos and in a non-productive state(As servers cost money). You can still set-up most of them to work with the instructions that I provide.

## North Alabama Souvenir & Gifts DEMO (https://github.com/AustinCGomez/UAH-IS412-FInal-Project)
This is my very first django project and I learned so much. The website was made originally for my IS 412 course at the University of Alabama in Huntsville(UAH). The project is not perfect but I did a lot of work on the front-end to the models and views. I learned a lot and had a fun time working on it. Included in the project is an extensive amount of documentation and a twenty-one page technical document detailing the planned system analysis of this project!
